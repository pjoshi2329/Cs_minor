To build a multithreaded program which inputs n values in an array and outputs the maximum, minimum and average elements among them
Write a program using pthread library and create three threads for min, max and avg each
Call for a the respective function in the main() function which gives the desired output

Operating it on Linux Ubuntu-
Open your code location by cd commands
And enter the following commands to run it
   gcc "filename.c" -lreadline
   ./a.out
Enter the desired number of size of the array and proceed to give in those many inputs
Result will be given in three print statements of max value , min value and avg value
